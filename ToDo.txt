Things to Do:

1. Finish the officer pictures and bios, I did the first half of what you sent but I think it would be a good idea for you to do some so you know how to modify it if needed. The instructions should be pretty clear within the comments of the about.html page. 

2. Links for the contact info in the footer, I've included links to email and facebook (you need to fill in the urls), more can be added by copy/pasting 

3. Change the flickr photostream, this can be done by finding the flickr id of your account (http://idgettr.com/) and the specific set (the setID is in the URL) that you want, change the values in the file "script.js" under the "js" folder.

4. Set up a google calendar. I think the best way to do this would be to create a google account for COSA for emails and events, and use this guide: https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/41207?hl=en to get the right url for the calendar (change the URL on the calendar.html page) 

5. Host it, if you need help with this let me know but it should just be a function of copying all the files in this folder ("css", "img", "js" folders and all HTML files) onto the host server (I think you guys have an OCF server)
